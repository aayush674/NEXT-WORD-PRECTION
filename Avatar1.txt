My Date with Drew
  u4825      You know that you're in my house
L164841  u4831      Lying to you -- Why should I?
L164840  u4825      You're lying
L164839  u4831      I didn't
L164838  u4825      I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming
L164695  u4831      He lied to me again
L164694  u4825      That's my business -- Now, it's all right,   What did he do?
L164626  u4831      T you,  --
L164625  u4825       --
L164624  u4831      No, t you -- what's your name?
L164623  u4825      You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music  You need your sleep Is there anything else you want?
L164622  u4825      I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs Stone --
L164621  u4831       -- ?
L164803  u4839      No, siree, it didn't And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr Stone
L164802  u4826      But it didn't stop I know it didn't stop  told me it didn't
L164801  u4839      You're wrong, Mr Stone There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains
L164800  u4826      Anybody can see that
L164799  u4839      Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West
L164798  u4826      What's that, sir?
L164797  u4839      Maybe you can, sometime,  I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself
L164796  u4826      Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
L164795  u4839      No,  -- they are not race horses They are good old friends of mine I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then
L164794  u4826      Make them go faster, Mr ?
L164793  u4839      It does hurt! And don't you do it again
L164792  u4826      Why? It don't hurt
L164791  u4839      ! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
L164790  u4839      And serve him right!
L164789  u4826      Well, I thought he'd come in the middle
L164788  u4839      And what about  ?
L164787  u4826      I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
L164786  u4839      A varied list of attractions And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
L164785  u4826      'N   will be there
L164784  u4839      Young man -- you got me there
L164783  u4826      And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
L164782  u4839      Guess there will, if it says so
L164781  u4826      No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
L164780  u4839      It hasn't opened yet?
L164779  u4826      Gee -- that Fair --
L164778  u4839      All right,  Jump in
L164777  u4826      Well, I wouldn't mind  But my name's  Stone
L164776  u4839      Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
L164956  u4831      All right, darling
L164955  u4826      I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama I want to be with you
L164954  u4831      !  You must go to sleep
L164953  u4826      Mama!
L164823  u4826      No, no, I don't want to go to bed I want to be here for the party
L164822  u4831      , you ought to be in bed
L164690  u4831      !   I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
L164689  u4826      No! No! I won't
L164688  u4831       give me that beanshooter!
L164687  u4826      It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
L164686  u4831      Yes, you did, ! I saw it from the window And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, !
L164710  u4826      Not me! 
L164709  u4829      I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off
L164708  u4826      Grandma, look at me!
L164685  u4826      I did not, Grandma
L164684  u4829      Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
L164683  u4829      That's just too bad --
L164682  u4826      But I like the new one better
L164681  u4829      Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us
L164680  u4826      , when do we move to the new house?
L164532  u4828      Now don't you worry about that You just leave it all to me We won't talk business now  just bear this in mind  I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck No, sir not me! 
L164531  u4827      Say  about the interest 
L164529  u4827      Ts,  -- I really wouldn't need very much  if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting 
L164528  u4828      Not at all,   not at all Glad to help you
L164527  u4827      Don't I?  Say, that's mighty white of you, 
L164526  u4828      Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser  while I'm around
L164525  u4827      Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
L164524  u4828      I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me
L164523  u4827      Well -- here's how it is  , Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it What you think about it?
L164522  u4828      Why, of course,  -- I've always got time for a neighbor What's on your mind?
L164521  u4827      Kin you spare a moment for me ?
L164520  u4828      Howdy, 
L164519  u4827      Howdy, 
L165032  u4838       We'll be mighty glad to have you with us
L165031  u4828      Why, t you,  I was going to ask you if you thought I could
L165030  u4838        -- will you join our Grange now?
L164291  u4828      I'll look out for myself!  Now go away -- leave me alone
L164290  u4838       Well -- we don't mean to force you,  Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good
L164287  u4838       That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day
L164286  u4828      What Grange?
L164285  u4838       Howdy, Mr Stone We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
L164284  u4828      What do you want?
L164204  u4828      Black Dan'l?
L164203  u4838       Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy   is fighting for it right now--
L164202  u4828      I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington
L164201  u4838       That's fair enough,  Man's got a right to mull things over We'll drive round again, week or so
L164200  u4828      Sure does But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights
L164194  u4838       Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
L164193  u4828      Sure am
L164192  u4838       Are you one of old ' cusers too?
L164191  u4828      Too bad it didn't happen to Miser 
L164190  u4838       Loan shark -- hey?
L164615  u4828       --
L164614  u4837    THE WOMAN  
L164613  u4828      Never mind What's your name?
L164610  u4837    THE WOMAN  But she is -- I've taken her place Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter Mrs Stone was too ill
L164609  u4828      She couldn't be gone!
L164608  u4837    THE WOMAN  No She's gone
L164607  u4828      You're not -- Dorothy
L164863  u4828       -- what's all this leading up to? You know something Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
L164862  u4836      I do -- and I think you should too
L164861  u4828      Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
L164860  u4836      What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
L164859  u4828      All right -- so it's buried with you!
L164858  u4836      Don't say that -- I know it is --
L164857  u4828      Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
L164856  u4836      But what becomes of our souls?
L164855  u4828      Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all
L164854  u4836      -- of what happens after we die!
L164853  u4828      Afraid  of what?
L164852  u4836      You are afraid!
L164851  u4828      What's the matter with you?
L164849  u4836      Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
L164848  u4828      Almost seven  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
L164847  u4836      What a fine boy you have,  How old is he now?
L164846  u4828      Now run along, 
L164832  u4828      I dunno -- I can't figure it out I've invited them all Why don't they come?
L164831  u4836      Where's everybody?
L164830  u4828      No, you're not
L164829  u4836      Good evening -- I'm sorry,  -- I'm a little late
L164661  u4828      Some other time, 
L164660  u4836      Yes, I wanted to get here before the others I want to talk to you alone
L164659  u4828      Hello,   you're early today
L164658  u4836      Mornin',  
L164339  u4828      Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad
L164338  u4836      Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property
L164337  u4828      You know -- some folks are just lucky Others pick gold right out of the air  Like that!
L164336  u4836      I'd like to know where you'd get it
L164335  u4828      -- in gold
L164334  u4836      No, Stone!
L164333  u4828      I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
L164332  u4836      Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
L164331  u4828      !
L164997  u4833      Gentlemen, the prosecution rests
L164996  u4828      You know darn well it is
L164995  u4833      But, Mr Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience  Is this your signature?
L164994  u4828      Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich I can't think of anything but money That's the trouble with me
L164991  u4833      That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor
L164990  u4828      Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing  that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money That was a lie, a lie, a lie
L164989  u4833       Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
L164952  u4828      Never!
L164951  u4833      Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
L164950  u4828      About what?
L164949  u4833      Well now, Mr Stone, did you make up your mind?
L164909  u4833      Come, come, Mr Stone, you are a little upset It's not fair to bargain with you now -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr Stone, but not one minute more Ah, then you'll come with me indeed
L164908  u4828      No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now
L164907  u4833      I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son 
L164906  u4828      Anything -- anything -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
L164905  u4833      Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man I'm always open to reason With a little security -- I might--
L164904  u4828      Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up
L164903  u4833      Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose
L164902  u4828      I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything
L164901  u4833      What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences
L164900  u4828      I'm through with you
L164899  u4833      Trying to break our contract again, Mr Stone?
L164898  u4828      My time isn't up yet
L164897  u4833      Small? Oh, I see what you mean Why, they vary  Now a man like  , if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing  In your case --
L164896  u4828      Are they all as -- small -- as that?
L164894  u4833      He was --
L164893  u4828      He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there
L164892  u4833       Miser ' soul, Mr Stone Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance
L164888  u4833      Just a minute, neighbor Stone I promised you money and all that money can buy I don't recall any other obligations But let's look at the contract
L164887  u4828      You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
L164886  u4833      Why, Mr Stone, you look so worried Can I be of any service?
L164561  u4833      Oh, certainly I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake Yes, I might do that
L164560  u4828      Leave your tongue off of that!
L164559  u4833      But you should, now that you are becoming a father
L164558  u4828      I don't care
L164557  u4833      Oh come, Neighbor Stone I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you It means a breach of contract
L164556  u4828      Look here now--
L164555  u4833      Good evening, Neighbor Stone
L164307  u4833      1840 Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847
L164306  u4828      The seventh day of April --
L164305  u4833      Yes, indeed But not now Not for seven years Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
L164304  u4828      Well, I'll be -- 
L164303  u4833      Excellent A firm, fair signature One that will last till doomsday  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
L164301  u4833      A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
L164300  u4828      No, no! Give it to me!
L164299  u4833      Well, why should that worry you A soul -- a soul is nothing Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
L164298  u4828      What does it mean here -- about my soul?
L164297  u4833      That's right, Mr Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality I'd like your signature here -- see And when it's done -- it's done for seven years  It's our usual form Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time
L164296  u4828      It's mine?
L164295  u4833      Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen
L164294  u4828      Yes, why shouldn't it?
L164293  u4833      Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
L164292  u4828      Where did it come from?
L164279  u4833      A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man All he needs is a friend to point it out to him  Like that!
L164278  u4828      Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right But--
L164277  u4833      Of course Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people You make them work for you
L164276  u4828      Opportunities?
L164275  u4833      You've had a lot of bad luck these days And yet -- it's all so unnecessary When I think of your opportunities --
L164274  u4828      You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire If I say I called you, I did  I guess I did
L164273  u4833      Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire
L165029  u4839      Breakfast  Ah!  Come along friends, 's a cook this side of heaven
L165028  u4828      Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr !
L165022  u4839      I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it But it takes more than that to down  
L165021  u4828      Well, I --
L165020  u4839      You were worried, , weren't you?
L164937  u4839      Oh, come, man, come Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler
L164936  u4828      There's no joy in it for me
L164935  u4839      There's nothing like it I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee Come -- try a nip!
L164933  u4839      Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug
L164932  u4828      Not long -- now
L164931  u4839      They make plucky women in New England  H'm  how long have we to wait?
L164924  u4828      Yes -- at midnight
L164923  u4839      I see And this is where he'd like to collect, too
L164922  u4828      Yes, Mr  -- it was here where it all began
L164921  u4839      It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
L164880  u4828      It's your fault! You brought   here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
L164879  u4839      No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child
L164878  u4828      I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
L164877  u4839      I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you,  -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it
L164876  u4839      They'd have a good neighbor,  -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
L164875  u4828      Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything
L164874  u4839      You,  Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr Stone?
L164873  u4828      What -- what's on your mind?
L164872  u4839      That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me,  -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you,  They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too Do you know what I'm talking about, ?
L164871  u4828      Well -- Mr ! This is a great day for me Come on in, sir I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
L164428  u4839      Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little  Sampson from Franklin

L164397  u4839      Not at all, lad -- not at all  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim
L164396  u4828      Seems like it's my fault, Mr 
L164395  u4839      I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners

L164570  u4831      Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined 
L164518  u4828      I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways Now, I've made up my mind
L164517  u4831       -- once you said we'd never change --
L164514  u4828      And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife

L164512  u4828      Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it
L164511  u4831      But  -- the washing has to be done --
L164510  u4828      But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
L164509  u4831      It's very becoming to you, Mr Selectman
L164508  u4828      I'm serious
L164507  u4831      Yes, Mr Selectman!
L164506  u4828      That's one thing I want to talk to you about, 
L164505  u4831      I'll never get my washing done
L164504  u4828      You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me
L164494  u4831      Oh --

L164459  u4828      Yes -- you are right,  I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
L164458  u4831      There's hope and promise in it,  -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come
L164454  u4828       -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man
L164453  u4831      You'll never change -- will you?
L164452  u4828      There is nothing to worry about now
L164451  u4831      Worried!
L164450  u4828      Tired?
L164449  u4831      But I'm glad to be home again --
L164448  u4831      Oh,  -- it was a wonderful day --
L164447  u4828      Remember, , how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself,  Stone," and it was my first speech I don't know what came into me,  I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth
L164436  u4828      Yes,   It's been a long day
L164435  u4831      We must go on home, 
L164358  u4828      Looks right elegant, 
L164357  u4831      What do you think of that, ?
L164327  u4831      I'd love to
L164326  u4828      Will you come into town with me orrow?
L164325  u4831      It feels fine now, 
L164315  u4828       -- look! Hessian gold I found it in the barn
L164314  u4831      Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same
L164313  u4828       -- what would you do?
L164312  u4831      !
L164311  u4828       -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
L164267  u4831      No,  -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt Everything'll be all right then  everything
L164266  u4828      I'll get the doctor
L164263  u4828       -- how do you feel?
L164262  u4831       
L164261  u4828      --
L164250  u4828      You're right,  it's a fine calf That's why 'll take it for the rest of the payment
L164249  u4831      Oh ! And we were counting on   It's a lovely calf
L164248  u4828      Seed alone won't do,  We have to throw the calf in
L164247  u4831      !
L164237  u4828      I will,  -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that
L164236  u4831       -- you ought to talk to  about joining the Grange
L164235  u4828      , I'm a farmer -- always will be To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right We just got to do it Oh -- how's it all going to end?
L164234  u4831      You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
L164233  u4828      To save us work on the spring plowing?
L164232  u4831      ! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
L164231  u4828      If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him
L164230  u4831      It's all right,  We'll find something to pay 
L164229  u4828      Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time After all, we can't very well do without a horse
L164228  u4831      Not all of it?
L164227  u4828       -- it's gone
L164226  u4831      Do you think I'm grudging it?
L164225  u4828      Your butter money?
L164224  u4831      We can still use my butter money
L164223  u4828      Well -- what are we going to do?
L164216  u4828      If it would only move old Miser  -- We've still got to pay him
L164215  u4831      That's wonderful language It would move a stone
L164214  u4828      "  and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
L164170  u4828      It's   and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
L164169  u4831      Who is it?
L164168  u4828      Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate
L164158  u4828      Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done  Go on reading, Ma This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
L164157  u4831      He's stubborn as a Stone
L164152  u4828      That's what we said
L164151  u4831      , don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse We said it's for richer or poorer
L164150  u4828      I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first
L164149  u4828      Yep
L164148  u4831      Oh, 
L164147  u4828      I think his leg is broken
L164140  u4828      You're right, 
L164139  u4831      Now, ! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is
L164138  u4828      What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
L164134  u4828      All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
L164133  u4831      He only wants you to throw the stick for him,  I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too
L164132  u4828      Down, Shep! Down!
L164131  u4828      Coming
L164130  u4831       -- help!
L165025  u4829      Of course it's all right, son You had  , didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr 
L165024  u4828      Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
L164915  u4829      Gone with   -- to Marshfield, son You told  to go--
L164914  u4828      Ma!   Where's   and little Dan'l?
L164913  u4829      My son  what's the matter?
L164654  u4829      And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman!
L164653  u4828      I want you to fix these fish!
L164604  u4828      Sure, Ma
L164603  u4829      You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy
L164594  u4829      Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it Got better music to listen to than that  There -- that's what I mean
L164593  u4828      Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight
L164592  u4829      You'll be a father any minute now
L164591  u4828      Ma -- is she? --
L164569  u4828      Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
L164568  u4829      Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop But we'll make out
L164567  u4828      I say -- it don't matter
L164566  u4829      What's that you say, Son?
L164565  u4828      It don't matter!
L164564  u4829      Oh, here you are,  Lan's, I was worried about you Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
L164553  u4829      A man can always change things, Son That's what makes him different from barnyard critters
L164552  u4828      Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
L164551  u4829      You see, son? I'm old and I've lived When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him
L164550  u4829      Wouldn't profit him none
L164549  u4828      I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
L164548  u4829      Why, that's just sense, Son Now a man like   -- guess they pay him high for what he does But he's worth it -- and he helps others Makes all the difference
L164547  u4828      Do you really think that?
L164546  u4829      I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son
L164545  u4828      Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
L164544  u4828      Me -- a son
L164543  u4829      Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you
L164542  u4828      I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all
L164541  u4829      Well, t the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather We've got enough for the whole United States
L164540  u4828      Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else
L164538  u4829      Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance
L164537  u4828      My son! Do you really think, Ma
L164536  u4829      It won't be the first baby ever born in this house  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world
L164516  u4828      Now look here, Ma I'm not a boy anymore I want that understood I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life 's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
L164515  u4829      Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again
L164324  u4828      Say, , how is your shoulder?
L164323  u4829      Well -- that's comforting!  Supper
L164319  u4828      But it's true Take 'em up in your hands,  -- feel 'em -- they're real all right  Aren't you glad?
L164318  u4829      Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell  Don't seem right, somehow!
L164317  u4828      Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was
L164316  u4829      You found it in the barn, hey?
L164260  u4828      I can't help it I mean it, I tell you I've had more than my share Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
L164259  u4829      Hush up such talk, !
L164258  u4828      And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good  Consarn it He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him   up there, just what I think
L164257  u4829      Well  make him keep quiet
L164256  u4828      I dunno
L164255  u4829      What's ailing that dog?
L164246  u4829      All right, son -- if it helps
L164245  u4828      Helps sometimes to say it
L164244  u4829      That's a word you're too free with lately, , consarn this and consarn that 
L164243  u4828      Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
L164242  u4829      I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills
L164241  u4828      How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
L164164  u4829      Not on the Sabbath you won't, !
L164163  u4828      There! Guess that ought to hold good Put him down here, by the fire,   But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper
L164162  u4828      That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
L164161  u4829      Now,  Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it That and codfish
L164160  u4828      Hard luck -- like me
L164159  u4829      You know that, son
L164156  u4828      Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
L164155  u4829      ! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!

L164811  u4829      So you've made up your mind to go to the party
L164716  u4831      I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
L164715  u4829      What's that?
L164714  u4831      Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
L164713  u4829      Me? Why, look here,  Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all
L164712  u4831      Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself

L164321  u4829      H'm Hessian gold Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians
L164320  u4831      I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in
L164265  u4831      Yes,  -- don't worry
L164264  u4829      Let her be, son She'll do all right You better get yourself straightened out
L164167  u4829      Land sakes, I don't mind I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture He took on too much to suit me I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts Yes, , you go ahead and read
L164166  u4831      That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma
L164145  u4831      I guess we won't
L164144  u4829      Well, I guess we won't be going to church today
L164137  u4831      Coming, Ma
L164136  u4829       --  --
L164135  u4831      You throw mighty far,  -- almost into the pigsty
L164411  u4830    MARTIN  Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
L164410  u4839      Of course And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions As long as people do that -- the country's all right Do you understand, Martin?
L164409  u4830    MARTIN  Gee, would you, Mr ? Honest?
L164408  u4839      Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you
L164407  u4830    MARTIN  Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners He said you had horns and a tall, Mr , but I ain't seen 'em yet
L164406  u4839      What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
L165034  u4831      She'll be here in a moment She has a special surprise for you
L165033  u4839      There is nothing like a good old country breakfast Where's Ma?
L164928  u4839      I'll do my best, 
L164927  u4831      Mr  -- you will help him?
L164926  u4839       -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady
L164925  u4831       
L164870  u4839      Are you, ?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way  Party seems to be quite a success  Lots of guests, anyhow
L164869  u4831      Oh -- Mr  -- I'm so glad you came!
L164741  u4839      And now come on,  I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
L164740  u4831      Oh, could you, Mr  ?
L164739  u4839       -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked Don't you believe it Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things
L164738  u4831      You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is  He was the first man I loved He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding That's not like him, Mr  -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault
L164737  u4839      You don't have to defend him to me,  -- I've been called names myself
L164736  u4831      Mr , you mustn't believe all that people say
L164735  u4839      I've heard some odd things about  lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself
L164734  u4831      Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr  There's this matter of little 's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on  and I won't stand for that
L164733  u4839      Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, , forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point And there is a point, isn't there?
L164732  u4831      Goodness, Mr , I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner
L164731  u4839      No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs
L164730  u4831      Of course not --
L164729  u4839      Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
L164728  u4831      No, really, t you -- Is Mrs  coming back soon?
L164727  u4839      Well , it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
L164431  u4831      -- I'm going to try, Mr 
L164430  u4839      You've got a smart man, Mrs Stone Hang onto him
L164429  u4831      It is
L164726  u4839      Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off I've got to see a friend
L164725  u4832    OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE  Just someone from New Hampshire!
L164724  u4839      If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
L164723  u4832    OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE  Someone to see you, Dan'l!
L164722  u4839      Hullooo!
L164721  u4832    OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE  Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
L165016  u4839      Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you 
L165015  u4833      My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen
L164985  u4839      I object
L164984  u4833      Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by  Stone That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A
L164973  u4839      I'll drink to that, Mr !
L164972  u4833      The quick or the dead! You have said it  May -- the best man win, Mr !

L164970  u4833      Very well -- You shall have your trial, Mr  The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
L164969  u4839      I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians

L182522  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  And?
L182521  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  He runs call girls  Primo tail Fixed up like movie stars
L182520  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Reciprocity, Mr Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships
L182519  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  And what?
L182518  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  And?
L182517  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  Okay  Okay  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks  From aviation, freeway construction  But the man has hobbies, too  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o
L182514  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Alright  We'll drop that line for now  Next topic  Please comment on Pierce Patchett
L182513  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  Okay so we worked together  It was an information exchange  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories  We were friends for Chrissakes!
L182512  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  What does that have to do --
L182511  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  But you were business associates?
L182510  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean

L182666  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  <u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
L182665  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Something like that
L182664  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
L182663  u4997  m332  EXLEY  <u>No</u>
L182659  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Absolutely  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds  Anesthetize them  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care  It's still a crime free city for respectable people
L182658  u4997  m332  EXLEY  And now you'll provide them
L182657  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  A vacuum, Edmund  That's what we have in Los Angeles  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it  My containment work maintained it Certain photographs guarantee it Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides
L182656  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Why?
L182655  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin  Through his whore girl friend  I sent him to make the buy  The rest is history
L182654  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Tell that to Jack Vincennes  To Stensland
L182653  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund
L182494  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Anonymous  Probably nothing
L182493  u4997  m332  EXLEY  No Where'd the tip come from?
L182190  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Something's wrong  I feel it inside  Doesn't that sound crazy?
L182189  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  There always are  But there are also three men and three guns Matched forensically  A few loose ends don't matter
L182188  u4997  m332  EXLEY  There are loose ends out there, Dudley  I --
L182150  u4997  m332  EXLEY  She may still be alive, whoever she is

L181926  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Yes, I do, sir
L181925  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it
L181924  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Sir, I took the call  It's my case
L181910  u4997  m332  EXLEY  His blood's always up
L181909  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  You should stay away from a man when his blood is up
L181808  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  So be it
L181807  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Yes, Dudley  I am
L181806  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
L181795  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  No, Edmund  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time
L181794  u4997  m332  EXLEY  White's a mindless thug
L181793  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Stensland's a disgrace  Straight D fitness reports from every CO he ever served under  But White is a valuable officer
L181754  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  At least get rid of the glasses I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them
L181753  u4997  m332  EXLEY  I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did  Or my father
L181752  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Then for God's sake, don't be a detective  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau
L181751  u4997  m332  EXLEY  No
L181750  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
L181749  u4997  m332  EXLEY  No
L181748  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
L181747  u4997  m332  EXLEY  No
L181746  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?  Yes or no, Edmund
L181745  u4997  m332  EXLEY  I No
L181744  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Answer yes or no
L181743  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Dudley, we've been over this
L181742  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Am I?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
L181741  u4997  m332  EXLEY  You're wrong
L181739  u4997  m332  EXLEY  I was thinking Detective Bureau

L181737  u4997  m332  EXLEY  The youngest applicant by eight years
L181736  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  That was his favorite toast  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam  You placed first out of twenty-three
L182488  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Not even with Exley?
L182487  u4999  m332  JACK  No
L182486  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
L182485  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  Don't start trying to do the right thing, John  You haven't had enough practice
L182484  u4999  m332  JACK  It's a private investigation  I fucked something up and I want to make amends
L182483  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  You're Narco, lad, not Homicide And since when do you work with Edmund?
L182482  u4999  m332  JACK  Part of it has to do with a murder  I've been working with Ed Exley on it
L182481  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  What's this all about, lad?
L182480  u4999  m332  JACK  Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam  Guy ran hookers He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail  Charges got dropped  Insufficient evidence You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it
L182479  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  A disgrace as a policeman Straight D fitness reports from every CO he ever served under What about him?
L182478  u4999  m332  JACK  You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

L182104  u4999  m332  JACK  You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
L181817  u4999  m332  JACK  Okay  I'll do it
L181816  u4996  m332  DUDLEY  John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath  Don't start now

L182363  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Rollo's the reason I became a cop I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
L182362  u4999  m332  JACK  So what's the point?
L182361  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Rollo was a purse snatcher  My father ran into him off duty  He shot my father six times and got away clean  No one even knew who he was  I made the name up to give him some personality
L182360  u4999  m332  JACK  Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
L182358  u4999  m332  JACK  You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>
L182357  u4997  m332  EXLEY  It's a simple question

L182348  u4999  m332  JACK  Yesterday that might've meant something  Pull me off  You'd be doing me a big favor
L182347  u4997  m332  EXLEY  It's not a request  I need to know what White knows  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor'  Permanently

L181827  u4999  m332  JACK  You're playing an angle, college boy  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching  If they're making you a detective, watch out  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs
L181826  u4997  m332  EXLEY  You're the payoff expert  I'm just doing my duty

L182462  u4997  m332  EXLEY  I don't hate White  I really don't  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for
L182461  u5001  m332  LYNN  Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
L182460  u5001  m332  LYNN  I see  because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is  There's more if you want to hear it
L182459  u4997  m332  EXLEY  I'll take your word for it
L182458  u5001  m332  LYNN  I see  because I want to  I see  because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him

L182445  u5001  m332  LYNN  The way you've underestimated  White?
L182444  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken
L182443  u5001  m332  LYNN  It galls you that I know so much about you  You don't have information to compete
L182441  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Why?
L182440  u5001  m332  LYNN  I'm curious about you
L182438  u5001  m332  LYNN  He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant Pierce also taught me how to fuck Can I get you a drink?
L182437  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Let's concentrate on my smarts Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down
L182436  u5001  m332  LYNN  He said you were smart  He also said you were competing with your dead father  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost
L182435  u4997  m332  EXLEY  Really?  What did White say?
L182434  u5001  m332  LYNN  I know who you are  You're the policeman  told me about

L182257  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  I put Reynolds in the cab myself The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis
L182256  u4999  m332  JACK  Loew didn't go with him  You're sure?

L182225  u4999  m332  JACK  Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
L182204  u4998  m332  HUDGEONS  He's queer too  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues  On screen and off  I'm getting him to fuck the DA for a hundred bucks  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career
